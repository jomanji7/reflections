What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
to track the files in that repository, and distinct them from the other project/file that is being tracked.
i dont know why i need to do it yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it contains the files that are ready to be committed, and already added to the tracked files on the repository, its the place between working directory and commits.
